      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slackeee - Slack End-to-End Encryption&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;rsquo;t really a blog post per se, but more of a &amp;ldquo;Hey, I did this thing&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a browser extension that adds end-to-end encryption to Slack messages. It started out as a small hackathon project, but I&amp;rsquo;ve been polishing it up and adding features since then.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The extension is available for Firefox, but written for cross-compatibility (I just haven&amp;rsquo;t gotten around to publishing it to the Chrome Web Store yet), and you can find the source code on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/halfspacer/slackeee&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Write Code Like George R.R. Martin</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;George R.R. Martin, the writer behind A Song of Ice and Fire, is renowned for weaving intricate narratives with dozens of characters, sprawling kingdoms, and hidden plot threadsâ€”all while keeping readers engrossed. His secret? Clarity amidst complexity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Software architects and developers can learn a lot from Martinâ€™s approach. Just as he ensures his epic tales remain accessible to readers, developers must write code thatâ€™s comprehensible to anyone who encounters itâ€”especially those unfamiliar with its underlying complexities. This philosophy fosters modular design, extensibility, and maintainability while reducing bugs and accelerating junior developer onboarding. Letâ€™s explore why coding like a storyteller pays dividends.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;nativeaot-in-net-harder-better-faster-stronger&#34;&gt;NativeAOT in .NET: Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Over the past few months, Iâ€™ve been diving (sinking?) deep into the world of .NET performance optimizations as part of trying to write better cloud services with less hassle. &amp;ldquo;Switch to Go! Or Rust!&amp;rdquo; - I hear you.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;But now hear me out:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll share my personal experiences and practical tips on using NativeAOT to achieve rapid startup times and a smaller memory footprint in .NET applicationsâ€”without any hype, just what worked for me, and all without having to leave the comforting embrace of Satya Nadella (CEO, Microsoft).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
