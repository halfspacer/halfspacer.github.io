But this isn’t a post about finger-pointing or rehashing the incident. It’s a reflection on why inclusive communities matter, why they’re fragile, and why I’ll gladly stir up trouble if it means creating change.</p><p>A few months have passed. The chaos has subsided, my inbox has cooled, and I’ve (mostly) ditched the extra weight I collected over the holidays.<br>Let’s address the lingering questions:</p><ul><li><strong>Did Unity ever follow up publicly?</strong> Not that I’ve seen.</li><li><strong>Is the moderator still around?</strong> Yes, but quietly.</li><li><strong>Do I hold a grudge?</strong> Absolutely not. In fact, I’m cautiously optimistic. Change rarely happens without friction, and I’ve seen small signs of growth.</li></ul><p>My frustration wasn’t with individuals—it was with how easily even well-meaning communities can become unwelcoming. Let me explain why this hits close to home.</p><hr><h3 id=why-inclusivity-isnt-just-a-buzzword-a-confession-from-a-self-taught-programmer><strong>Why Inclusivity Isn’t Just a Buzzword (A Confession From a Self-Taught Programmer)</strong></h3><p>I didn’t grow up dreaming of code. In fact, I spent most of my school years avoiding math like it was that insidious curse from &ldquo;It Follows&rdquo; (Solid movie, btw). But in university, while studying Management, I found myself procrastinating by watching lectures from Harvard&rsquo;s &ldquo;Introduction to Computer Science&rdquo;, a course they annually film and &ldquo;Open source&rdquo; as part of their MOOC initiative.<br>Turns out, if you give me an exam to study for, I will do just about anything, including learning to code, as long as it&rsquo;s not studying for that exam.</p><p>It wasn’t glamorous. I spent hours debugging scripts that refused to run, Googling error messages that made no sense, and wrestling with concepts that seemed to click for everyone else. But online communities became my lifeline. Whether it was a Stack Overflow thread explaining recursion in plain English, Uncle Bob wasting my time with his clean code nonesense, or Freya Holmér&rsquo;s many-hour-long VODs on shader programming, I found my way through the maze.</p><p>That’s why the Unity Discord incident stung. It wasn’t just about a heated argument—it was a reminder of how quickly exclusionary dynamics can alienate people who <em>need</em> those lifelines, whether it&rsquo;s today or two years from now.<br>Because here’s the thing: People don&rsquo;t wake up one day and decide to be developers, especially in the game dev space. They stumble into it, often from the margins. Someone on the Discord asking a dumb question, or writing really terrible code, doesn&rsquo;t Have to be corrected, and doesn&rsquo;t Have to do everything the &ldquo;right&rdquo; way. Sometimes they just need a hand to hold, a nudge in the right direction, and a safe space to fail.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t spoonfeed them!&rdquo; - I hear you. But sometimes, all they need in this very moment is to not be blocked in whatever they&rsquo;re trying to do. In the case of Unity especially, these are often times kids, or people from non-technical walks of life just getting their toes wet. They might be years away from being a &ldquo;real&rdquo; developer, but they&rsquo;re here now, and they&rsquo;re trying to do something because they&rsquo;ve got a spark of curiosity.
That&rsquo;s why I will gladly write a snippet or code for someone, or just &ldquo;spoonfeed&rdquo; them the answer, if it means they can keep going on whatever little project they&rsquo;ve got going. When they&rsquo;re ready, they&rsquo;ll come back and ask for more.</p><hr><h3 id=brains-bias-and-why-one-size-fits-all-learning-fails><strong>Brains, Bias, and Why One-Size-Fits-All Learning Fails</strong></h3><p>Learning isn’t a monolith. Dr. Neil Fleming’s <a href=https://vark-learn.com/introduction-to-vark/the-vark-modalities/>VARK model</a> (a staple in educational psychology) breaks down how we absorb information:</p><ul><li><strong>Visual</strong> learners thrive on diagrams and flowcharts.</li><li><strong>Auditory</strong> learners (me!) need discussions or podcasts.</li><li><strong>Read/write</strong> types devour documentation.</li><li><strong>Kinesthetic</strong> learners, like many game devs, crave hands-on tinkering.</li></ul><p>But it’s deeper than that. A <a href=https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/human-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2013.00203/full>2013 study in <em>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience</em></a> found that cultural background, gender identity, and even socioeconomic factors shape how we approach problems. For example, neurodivergent developers might excel at spotting edge cases others overlook, while women in tech often develop razor-sharp communication skills navigating male-dominated spaces.</p><p>Diversity isn’t charity—it’s a strategic advantage. When we exclude voices, we lose out on perspectives that could transform our projects, strengthen our teams, and push our industry forward. Yet, we often default to “one-size-fits-all” learning, assuming everyone absorbs information the same way.</p><hr><h3 id=the-science-of-feeling-safe-and-why-it-matters-more-than-you-think><strong>The Science of “Feeling Safe” (And Why It Matters More Than You Think)</strong></h3><p>Ever tried debugging code while someone breathes down your neck? That’s what exclusionary environments feel like—your brain shifts into threat mode. Research from the <a href=https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-06545-001>Journal of Educational Psychology</a> shows that anxiety literally blocks cognitive processing. Conversely, feeling safe boosts creativity.</p><h4 id=so-how-do-we-get-there><strong>So… How Do We Get There?</strong></h4><p>Building inclusive communities isn’t about perfection—it’s about intention. Here’s what I’ve learned (often the hard way):</p><ol><li><p><strong>Ban “Just Google It” Culture</strong><br>Yes, RTFM matters. But dismissing questions as “obvious” ignores how differently we frame problems. I once spent hours debugging my code… only to realize I was inadvertently passing a value by reference. A kinder soul saved me with, “Hey, I’ve done this 100 times—mind if I peek?”</p></li><li><p><strong>Elevate Quiet Voices</strong><br>Introverts, non-native speakers, and marginalized folks often hesitate to speak up. When I’m in group settings, I try to explicitly invite input from those who haven’t shared yet. It’s a small gesture, but it works.</p></li><li><p><strong>Embrace “Unorthodox” Perspectives</strong><br>Some of the best ideas come from unexpected places. A teammate once suggested using a cooking recipe metaphor to explain a complex algorithm. It sounded bizarre at first, but it ended up being the clearest explanation we had.</p></li></ol><hr><h3 id=your-turn><strong>Your Turn</strong></h3><p>Inclusivity isn’t a checkbox—it’s a daily practice. Ask yourself:</p><ul><li><strong>What assumptions are you making about this person?</strong></li><li><strong>What circumstance would evoke the most empathy from you?</strong> (IE: Someone asks a &ldquo;Dumb&rdquo; question; Try to find the most charitable interpretation of why they&rsquo;re asking it- Maybe they&rsquo;re a single-parent trying to learn a new skill in their spare time, or a kid who&rsquo;s just starting out and doesn&rsquo;t know what they don&rsquo;t know yet)</li><li><strong>Could your “obvious feedback” be reframed with empathy?</strong> (Just give it a second pass before hitting send. I&rsquo;ve also been guilty of replying &ldquo;.. What am I even looking at?&rdquo;, but I&rsquo;ve learned to take a step back and remind myself that my negative comment does a lot more damage to them than it does good for my ego).</li></ul><p>Communities aren’t broken by single explosions—they erode through a thousand microcuts. But they’re also healed through small, stubborn acts of generosity. Let’s get to work.</p><hr></div><div class=prev-next></div><div class=back-home style=margin-top:20px><a href=/>← Back to Home</a></div></div></main><footer class=footer><span>&copy; 2025 Actual Lava</span></footer></body></html>
